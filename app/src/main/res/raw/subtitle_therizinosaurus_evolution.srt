1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,210
The

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,570
long

3
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,250
claws!

4
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,810
Therizinosaurus

5
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,160
holds

6
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,230
the

7
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:03,670
record

8
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:03,930
for the

9
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,490
longest

10
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:04,830
claws

11
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:04,940
of

12
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,230
any

13
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,550
animal.

14
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,430
These

15
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:06,840
giant

16
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,280
claws

17
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,460
were

18
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:07,790
over

19
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,110
3

20
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:08,400
feet

21
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,570
in

22
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,010
length.

23
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:09,890
Even

24
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,030
though

25
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,150
the

26
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,640
claws

27
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:10,870
looked

28
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,200
like they

29
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,310
were

30
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,710
used

31
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,080
to kill

32
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,460
prey,

33
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:12,830
the

34
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,250
claws

35
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:13,370
were

36
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,010
actually

37
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,340
used to

38
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:14,650
hold

39
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,010
down

40
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,440
branches

41
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:15,660
so

42
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,740
Therizinosaurus

43
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:16,900
could

44
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,160
eat

45
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,480
leaves

46
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,820
higher

47
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:17,990
up.

48
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:18,690
The

49
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,140
claws

50
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,280
could

51
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,610
still

52
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:19,880
be

53
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,200
used to

54
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,670
protect

55
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,110
itself

56
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,300
from

57
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:21,860
predators

58
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,040
if

59
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,470
needed.
