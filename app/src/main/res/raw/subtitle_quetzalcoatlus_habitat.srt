Quetzalcoatlus

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,440
lived

3
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:01,770
in what

4
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,160

7
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:03,950
This

8
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,520
pterosaur

9
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:04,650

12
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,030
distances

13
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,360
looking

14
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:06,510
for

15
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:06,810
dead

16
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,230
bodies

17
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,330

scavenge.

19
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,230
However,

20
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,610
it

21
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:09,900
wasnâ€™t

22
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,290
only

23
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,330
a

24

25
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,630
Quetzalcoatlus

26
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:12,750
would

27
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,070
also

28
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,770
frequently

29
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,120

30
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,410

31
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:14,860
ponds

32
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,210
and wait

33
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,380
for

34
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,780

36
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:16,820
like

37
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,450
crabs,

38
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,020
so it

39
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,230

40
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,490
