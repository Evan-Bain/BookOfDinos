1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,300
The

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,690
mighty

3
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,320
club

4
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,070
! The

5
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,400
club

6
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,670
at the

7
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,000
end of

8
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,870
Ankylosaurus'

9
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,170
tail

10
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,320
is

11
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,950
definitely

12
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,100
the

13
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,670
craziest

14
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,910
thing

15
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,240
about

16
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,420
this

17
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,230
dinosaur.

18
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:07,740
The

19
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,070
club

20
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,460
was so

21
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:08,880
strong

22
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,120
that it

23
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,360
could

24
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,810
easily

25
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,230
shatter

26
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,350
the

27
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:10,710
bones

28
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:10,830
of

29
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,220
another

30
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,060
dinosaur.

31
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,710
Unfortunately,

32
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,490
today,

33
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:14,880
there are

34
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,210
no

35
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,750
animals

36
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,110
that have

37
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,530
clubs

38
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:16,830
on their

39
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,580
tails.
