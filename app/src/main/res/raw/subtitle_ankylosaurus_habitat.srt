00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,140
Ankylosaurus

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,410
lived

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:01,680
during

4
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,040
the late

5
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,700
Cretaceous

6
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,180
period

7
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,390
in a

8
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:03,870
warm,

9
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,620
tropical

10
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,370
habitat.

11
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,870
Paleontologists

12
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,200
guess

13
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,530
that this

14
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,130
dinosaur

15
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,280
had

16
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,610
very

17
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:08,850
few

18
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,630
predators,

19
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:09,960
but

20
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,200
if it

21
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,440
did

22
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:10,650
have

23
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:10,890
any

24
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,490
predators

25
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:11,580
the

26
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:11,910
mighty

27
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,480
T-Rex

28
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,690
could

29
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,020
have been

30
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,500
one.

31
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,100
As

32
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,580
scary

33
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:14,910
as this

34
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,480
dinosaur

35
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,020
looked,

36
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,290
it

37
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:16,470
was

38
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,100
actually

39
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,160
a

40
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:17,730
herbivore

41
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:17,970
that

42
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,240
ate

43
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:18,600
small

44
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,020
plants

45
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,380
close

46
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,650
to the

47
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,160
ground.
