00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,210
The

00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,620
huge

3
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,320
size!

4
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,880
Quetzalcoatlus

5
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,110
is the

6
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,660
largest

7
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,100
flying

8
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,480
animal

9
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:04,860
ever.

10
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:05,670
This

11
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,240
pterosaur

12
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,490
was the

13
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:06,910
size

14
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,090
of a

15
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,580
giraffe

16
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:07,910
and had a

17
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,550
wingspan

18
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:08,890
longer

19
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,090
than a

20
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,460
school

21
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,990
bus.

22
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:10,710
For a

23
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,050
long

24
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,500
time,

25
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,820
paleontologists

26
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,230
believed

27
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,210
Quetzalcoatlus

28
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,450
was

29
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:14,650
too

30
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,010
big to

31
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,330
fly.

32
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,640
However,

33
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:16,950
in

34
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,950
2021,

35
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,250
paleontologists

36
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:19,550
found

37
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,900
out that

38
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,890
Quetzalcoatlus

39
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,040
would

40
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,360
launch

41
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,780
itself

42
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,060
8

43
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,410
feet

44
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:22,660
into

45
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,010
the air

46
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,150
to

47
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,440
begin

48
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,870
flying.
