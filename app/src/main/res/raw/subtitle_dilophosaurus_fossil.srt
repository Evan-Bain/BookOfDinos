Dilophosaurus

was

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,840
found

Arizona.

This

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,190
fossil

Dilophosaurus,

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,040
so

00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,210
paleontologists

24
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:11,400
thought

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,050
called

30
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,860
‘Megalosaurus

Wetherilli.’

32
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,640
However,

00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:15,950
in

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,180
found,

40
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,670
which

41
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,050
led to

42
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,130
the

43
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,710
discovery

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,970
that the

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:21,620
from

1942

48
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:22,900
was

00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,250
part of

dinosaur

53
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:24,640
that they

54
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,290
eventually

55
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:25,700
named

56
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,780
Dilophosaurus.
