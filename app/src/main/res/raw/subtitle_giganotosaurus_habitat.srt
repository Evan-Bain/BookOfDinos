00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,330
Giganotosaurus

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:01,650
was one of

3
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:01,740
the

4
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,220
largest

5
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,850
carnivores

6
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,240
to ever

7
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:03,840
live.

8
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,560
Since

9
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:04,830
it was

10
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,070
so

11
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,670
big,

12
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:05,910
it

13
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,180
most

14
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,570
likely

15
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:06,930
hunted

16
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,230
down

17
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,530
large

18
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,190
sauropods

19
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:08,310
and

20
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,670
maybe

21
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,000
even a

22
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,810
titanosaur

23
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,140
called

24
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,550
Argentinosaurus.

25
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,060
Giganotosaurus

26
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,170
may

27
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:13,350
have

28
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,710
hunted

29
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:13,950
these

30
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,340
large

31
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,000
dinosaurs

32
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,240
with a

33
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,720
pack.
