lonely

3
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,550
Triceratops

4
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:01,640
is

5
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,130
slowly

6
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,610
walking

7
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,000
towards a

8
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,400
pond

9
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,630
when a

10
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,050
loud

11
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,390
roar

12
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,760
is heard

13
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,150
off in

14
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,230
the

15
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,960
distance.

16
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:06,590
The

17
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,560
Triceratops

18
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:07,990
faces

19
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,070
the

20
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,450
roar

21
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:08,830
instead

22
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:08,970
of

23
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,230
running

24
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:09,660
away,

25
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,220
even

26
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:10,330
though a

27
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:10,900
large

28
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,420
T-Rex

29
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,190
approaches.

30
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:12,980
This

31
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,960
Triceratops

32
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,110
is

33
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,390
not

34
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,800
scared

35
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,090
while the

36
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:15,730
T-Rex

37
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,120
tries

38
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,290
to

39
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:16,590
attack,

40
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,410
thanks

41
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:17,530
to a

42
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,130
large,

43
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:18,660
boney

44
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:18,930
frill

45
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,500
protecting

46
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:19,680
its

47
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,090
entire

48
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,530
body.

49
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,910
Eventually,

50
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,260
the

51
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,850
T-Rex

52
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,130
has to

53
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:23,360
give

54
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,730
up and

55
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,050
look for

56
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,390
food

57
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,790
somewhere

58
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,280
else,

59
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:25,910
because

60
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,860
Triceratops

61
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,010
is

62
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,330
off the

63
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:27,740
menu!
