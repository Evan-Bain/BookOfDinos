to them

as they

make

this

predators

31
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,610
like

32
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,570
Allosaurus,

33
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:12,990
it is

34
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,410
common

35
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:13,530
to

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,920
try

37
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,310
and kill

00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,380
dinner.

42
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,490
Today,

43
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,120
though,

44
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,360
the

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,660
herd

46
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:18,990
made the

47
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,350
journey

48
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,100
safely.

49
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:20,880
Maybe

50
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,480
Allosaurus

51
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:21,990
decided

52
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,350
coming

53
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:22,710
close

54
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,950
to a

55
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,250
herd

56
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,370
of

57
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,060
dinosaurs

58
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,390
taller

59
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,660
than a

60
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:24,960
house

61
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,320
wasn't

62
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,590
a good

63
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,060
idea.
