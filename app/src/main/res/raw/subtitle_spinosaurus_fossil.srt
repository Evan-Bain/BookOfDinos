00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,770
2008,

38
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,470
almost

over a

44
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,270
century,

45
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,610
paleontologists

46
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:21,960
believed

land

51
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:23,940
like

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,340
all other

53
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,260
dinosaurs.

54
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,380
However,

2014

60
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:28,930
gave

61
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,430
evidence

62
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:29,590
that

63
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,480
Spinosaurus

64
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,660
was

65
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,170
adapted

66
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,450
to an

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,710
lifestyle.

69
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,500
This

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,050
discovery
