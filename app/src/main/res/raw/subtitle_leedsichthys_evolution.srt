1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,220
The

2
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,690
giant

3
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,300
size!

4
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,540
Leedsichthys

5
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:02,760
is the

6
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,290
largest

7
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:03,560
fish

8
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:03,940
ever,

9
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,600
reaching

10
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,130
sizes

11
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,490
of up

12
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:05,570
to

13
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,310
55

14
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:06,690
feet.

15
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:07,530
It was

16
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:07,940
able

17
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,250
to get

18
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:08,490
this

19
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:08,720
big

20
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,140
because

21
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,500
it was a

22
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,960
filter

23
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,450
feeder.

24
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,060
A

25
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,490
filter

26
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:11,860
feeder

27
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,100
is an

28
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,610
animal

29
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:12,750
that

30
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,130
leaves

31
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,300
its

32
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,650
mouth

33
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,020
open

34
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,340
while

35
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:14,440
it

36
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,040
swims,

37
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,420
so

38
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:15,800
small

39
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,440
animals,

40
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:16,890
like

41
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,610
plankton,

42
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,100
can

43
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,330
get

44
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,720
trapped

45
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:18,890
in the

46
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,260
mouth

47
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,370
and

48
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,790
eaten.

49
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,600
During

50
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:20,680
the

51
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,050
middle

52
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,270
of the

53
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,000
Jurassic,

54
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,600
there was

55
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:22,920
a lot

56
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,050
of

57
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,580
plankton

58
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:23,780
which

59
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,090
helped

60
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,800
Leedsichthys

61
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,200
get this

62
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,490
big.
