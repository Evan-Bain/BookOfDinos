00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,550
BANG!

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,280
The

3
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,760
ocean’s

4
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,300
apex

5
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,810
predator,

6
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,130
Mosasaurus,

7
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:04,630
just

8
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:04,870
caught

9
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,020
and

10
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,410
gobbled

11
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:05,730
down a

12
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,560
plesiosaur.

13
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,280
It

14
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,700
doesn’t

15
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,110
stop

16
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:08,610
hunting,

17
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,240
though,

18
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:09,650
and

19
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,270
continues

20
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:10,480
into

21
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,830
deeper

22
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,270
water.

23
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,910
The

24
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,290
next

25
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,670
prey it

26
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,140
spots

27
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,470
isn’t

28
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:13,800
just

29
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,120
another

30
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,950
plesiosaur,

31
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,400
but

32
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,730
another

33
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,700
Mosasaurus.

34
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,360
It

35
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,060
immediately

36
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,550
starts

37
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,990
charging

38
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,470
forward,

39
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,240
beginning

40
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,280
a

41
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,660
fight

42
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:20,850
to the

43
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,110
death.

44
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:21,940
The

45
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,400
final

46
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,660
bite

47
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:22,850
is

48
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,210
landed

49
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:23,480
by the

50
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:23,910
first

51
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,660
Mosasaurus

52
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:24,970
when it

53
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,270
gets

54
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:25,570

55
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:25,970
the other

56
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,820
Mosasaurus

57
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:26,950
and

58
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:27,290
bites

59
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,680
out its

60
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,120
stomach.

61
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,100
Nothing

62
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,370
in the

63
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,770
ocean

64
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:29,880
was

65
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,190
safe

66
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:30,410
from

67
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,330
Mosasaurus,

68
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:31,810
not

69
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,120
even

70
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,430
another

71
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,400
