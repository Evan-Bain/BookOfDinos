Dilophosaurus

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:01,720
walked

4
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:01,900
the

5
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,270
earth,

6
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:02,860
it was

7

the

animal.

11
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,070
Since

12
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,410
it was

13
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:05,790
taller

14
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,120

00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,100
and

18
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,430
longer

19
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,770

car,

22
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,100
it was

23
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,310
the

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,640

28
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,700
Dilophosaurus

29
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,000
could be

30
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,400
found

31
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,890
hunting

32
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,000
in

33
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,790
rainforests

34
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:14,900
and

35
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,560
swamps.

36
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,170
The

00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:16,880
that it

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,110
ate

40
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,300
was

41
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:17,640
most

42
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:17,990
likely

43
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,340
small

44
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,040
dinosaurs

45
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,140

46
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,650
