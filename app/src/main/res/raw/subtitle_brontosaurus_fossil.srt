The

00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,660
first

3
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,140
fossil

4
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,260
of

5
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,070
Brontosaurus

6
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,280
was

7
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:02,640
found

8
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:02,940
during

9
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,120
the

10
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,440
1870s.

11
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,120
Unfortunately,

12
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,480
during

13
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,660
the

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:06,990
early

15
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,250
1900s,

16
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,390
paleontologists

17
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,660
thought

18
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:09,840
that

19
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,680
Brontosaurus

20
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:10,830
was

21
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,160
not a

22
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,370
new

23
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,240
dinosaur.

24
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,720
It

25
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:12,930
was

26
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,350
believed

27
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,680
to be

28
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:13,800
an

29
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,220
already

30
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,760
discovered

31
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,330
dinosaur

32
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,630
called

33
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,680
Apatosaurus.

34
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,850
However,

35
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,030
in

36
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,170
2015,

37
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,380
a

38
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,740
study

39
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,040
proved

40
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,190
that

41
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,060
Brontosaurus

42
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,210
and

43
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:21,960
Apatosaurus

44
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,080
were

45
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,440
different

46
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,370
dinosaurs.

47
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,450
Still,

48
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:24,870
some

49
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,860
paleontologists

50
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,100
aren't

51
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,490
certain

52
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:26,640
if

53
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,450
Brontosaurus

54
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:27,690
is a

55
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:27,990
real

56
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,830
dinosaur.

57
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,460
This

58
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:29,820
means

59
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,150
that it's

60
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,420
up to

61
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:30,720
you to

62
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,290
decide!
