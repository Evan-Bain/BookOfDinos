about

dinosaurs

many

crazy

One of

these

assumptions

46
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,590
stated

47
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,750
that

48
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,150
since

Stegosaurusâ€™

brain

51
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,670
was so

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,110
small

00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,040
had a

00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:25,720

Unsurprisingly,

Stegosaurus

00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:31,580
making

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:31,890
it one

71
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,100
of the
