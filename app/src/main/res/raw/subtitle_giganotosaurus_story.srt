the

largest

21
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,900
dinosaurs.

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,610
One

the herd

29
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:11,780
and

30
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,180
rips

31
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,560
flesh

32
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:12,950
off of

33
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,050
an

34
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,380
Argentinosaurus,

35
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:14,820
then

36
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,290
quickly

37
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,080
returns.

38
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:16,670
The

starts

41
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:17,900
shaking

42
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,200
while the

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,530
herd

44
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,020
tries

45
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,270
to run

46
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:19,500
away.

47
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:20,790
However,

48
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,200
the

49
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,770
attackers

50
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,280
continue

51
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,680
to take

52
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,060
turns

53
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,430
ripping

54
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:23,800
flesh

55
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,030
from the

56
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,370
same

57
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,000
dinosaur.

58
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,060
Soon,

59
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,570
the

60
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:26,920
injured

61
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,120
Argentinosaurus

62
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,280
is

63
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,550
too

64
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,900
hurt to

65
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,230
move

66
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,370
and

67
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,920
becomes

68
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,240
dinner

69
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,540
for the

70
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,930
Giganotosauruses.
