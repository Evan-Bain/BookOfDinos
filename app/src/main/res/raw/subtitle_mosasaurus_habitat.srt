Mosasaurus

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,270
hunted

3
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:01,700
almost

4
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,290
anything,

5
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,940
including

00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,600
sharks,

7
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,830
plesiosaurs,

8
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,290
and

9
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:05,590
even

10
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,820
other

11
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,750
mosasaurs.

12
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,580
It was

13
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:07,750
the

14
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,320

of the

17
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,770
oceans,

18
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,360
meaning

19
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,640
that it

20
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:10,770
would

21
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,090
only

22
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,320
be

23
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,610
eaten

24
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:11,810
by

25
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,020
other

26
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,960
mosasaurs.

27
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:13,820
Even

28
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:13,960
though

29
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,770
Mosasaurus

30
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,150
lived in

31
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,220
the

32
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,730
water,

33
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,240
it would

34
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,660
still

35
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,000
have to

36
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,310
come

37
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,530
to the

38
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,100

39
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,180

breathe

41
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:18,750
like
