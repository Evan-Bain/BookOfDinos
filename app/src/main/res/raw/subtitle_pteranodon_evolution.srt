1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,300
The

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,720
huge

3
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:00,990
wing

4
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,770
size!

5
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,250
The

6
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:02,520
wing

7
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,240
size,

8
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:03,690
also

9
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,020
called

10
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,920
"wingspan,"

11
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,190
could

12
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,490
reach

13
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:05,760
up to

14
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,390
23

15
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:06,630
feet

16
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,170
long.

17
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,250
Today,

18
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:08,460
the

19
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:08,760
bird

20
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,090
with the

21
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,600
longest

22
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,200
wingspan

23
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,320
is

24
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,680
12

25
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,220
feet.

26
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,910
Pteranodon's

27
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,960
wingspan

28
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,350
is more

29
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,530
than

30
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,920
twice

31
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,100
that

32
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,790
size!

33
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,230
Paleontologists

34
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,650
believe

35
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:16,830
that

36
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,190
since

37
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:17,370
its

38
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:17,970
wingspan

39
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,150
was

40
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,390
so

41
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,900
long,

42
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,170
it

43
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,350
would

44
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:19,740
often

45
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,130
glide

46
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,520
instead

47
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,610
of

48
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,090
flapping

49
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,240
its

50
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,600
wings a

51
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:21,950
lot.
