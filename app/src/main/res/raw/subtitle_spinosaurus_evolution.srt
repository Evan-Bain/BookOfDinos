00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,030
tail!

4
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:01,660
The

was

9
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,580
different

10
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:03,780

tails

15
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:05,530
because

00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:05,920
it gave

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,190
it the

itself

22
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:07,980
through

It

lengths

43
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:17,400
